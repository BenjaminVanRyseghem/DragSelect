# Project Page: Demo & Info

https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/dragSelect/

# Key-Features

- No dependencies
- Add drag selection.
- Choose which elements can be selected.
- Great browser support, works even like a charm on IE9
- Ease of use
- Lightweight, only ~1KB gzipped
- DragSelect was written with Performance in mind.
- Free & open source under MIT License

# Why?

Because aparently there is nothing that does not require jquery out there yet.

# 1. Installation
## easy

Just download the file (minified) and add it to your document:

```html
<script src="https://thibaultjanbeyer.github.io/dragSelect/ds.min.js"></script>
```

## npm

npm install --save-dev npm-dragselect

## bower

bower install --save-dev dragselect

That's it, you're ready to rock!
Of course you can also just include the function within your code to save a request.

# Usage

Now in your JavaScript you can simply pass elements to the function like so:

## simple

Choose which elements can be selected:

```javascript
dragSelect({
  selectables: document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-nodes')
});
```

## complete

All options are optional. You could also just initiate the dragselect by `var ds = dragSelect();` without any option.

```javascript
var ds = dragSelect({
  selectables: document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-nodes'), // node/nodes that can be selected. This is also optional, you could just add them later with .addSelectables.
  selector: document.getElementById('rectangle'), // draggable element. By default one will be created.
  area: document.getElementById('area'), // area in which you can drag. If not provided it will be the whole document.
  customStyles: false,  // If set to true, no styles (except for position absolute) will be applied by default.
  multiSelectKeys: ['ctrlKey', 'shiftKey', 'metaKey'],  // special keys that allow multiselection.
  onElementSelect: function(element) {}, // fired every time an element is selected. (element) = just selected node
  onElementUnselect: function(element) {}, // fired every time an element is de-selected. (element) = just de-selected node.
  callback: function(elements) {} // fired once the user releases the mouse. (elements) = selected nodes.
});

// if you add the function to a variable like we did, you have access to all its functions
// and can now use start() and stop() like so:
ds.getSelection();  // returns all currently selected nodes
ds.addSelectables(document.getElementsByClassName('selectable-node'));  // adds elements that can be selected. Intelligent algorythm never adds elements twice.
ds.stop();  // will teardown/stop the whole functionality
ds.start();  // reset the functionality after a teardown
```  

You can also use the "shift", "ctrl" or "command" key to make multiple independent selections.


## Properties:
| property | type | usage |
|--- |--- |--- |
|selectables |DOM elements (nodes) |OPTIONAL. The elements that can be selected |
|selector |single DOM element (node) |OPTIONAL. The square that will draw the selection. Autocreated by default |
|area |single DOM element (node) |OPTIONAL. The square in which you are able to select |
|customStyles |boolean |OPTIONAL. If true, no styles will be automatically applied (except position: absolute). Default: `false` |
|multiSelectKeys |array |OPTIONAL. These key will allow the user add more elements to the selection instead of clearing the selection. The only possible values are keys that are provided via the event object. So far: <kbd>ctrlKey</kbd>, <kbd>shiftKey</kbd>, <kbd>metaKey</kbd> and <kbd>altKey</kbd>. Provide an empty array `[]` if you want to turn off the funcionality. Default: `['ctrlKey', 'shiftKey', 'metaKey']` |
|onElementSelect |function |OPTIONAL. Fired every time an element is selected. This callback gets a property which is the selected node |
|onElementUnselect |function |OPTIONAL. Fired every time an element is de-selected. This callback gets a property which is the de-selected node |
|callback |function |OPTIONAL. Callback function that gets fired when the selection is released. This callback gets a property which is an array that holds all selected nodes |

## Methods:
When the function is saved into a variable `var foo = dragSelect()` you have access to all its inner functions. There are way more than listed here. Here are just the most usable:  

| method | properties | usage |
|--- |--- |--- |
|stop |/ |Will teardown/stop the whole functionality |
|start |/ |Reset the functionality after a teardown |
|getSelection |/ |Returns all currently selected nodes |
|addSelectables |DOM elements (nodes) |Adds elements that can be selected. Donâ€™t worry, a smart algorythm makes sure that nodes are never added twice |
|removeSelectables |DOM elements (nodes) |Remove elements that can be selected. Also removes the 'selected' class from those elements. |

## Classes
| name | trigger |
|--- |--- |
|.ds-selected |On elements that are selected
|.ds-hover |On elements that are currently hovered
|.ds-selector |On the selector element
